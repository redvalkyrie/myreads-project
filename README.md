## Synopsis
This program is created to simulate a book app in which a user may have books
 on 1 of 3 shelves (Want to Read, Currently Reading, and Read).  The user can
 click on the plus sign(+) on the bottom right of the screen in order to open the search can
 search for books, and add them to shelves on the home page using the corresponding
 drop-down menu.  Refer to SEARCH_TERMS.md for a complete list of accepted search
 terms that will return books.  The user may click the back arrow on the left side
 of the search bar to return to the home page.  In order to remove a book from the main
 page, select "None".

## Installation

With npm open, change directories into the project file(cd myreads-project).  Within
 the project folder, use npm start to begin the development server. A list of addresses is provided within the npm CLI for the program to be run through a web browser.
